I currently use it with another free online service called MicroBadger, a service I use to trigger custom Dockerbuilds after a base image such as alpine has been updated. This allows all my personal projects to be on the latest base image potentially improving performance and security.
Microservice sends a POST request to a function hosted on ZEIT NOW, and that function runs a bunch of tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>
