When looking at it from a passive monitoring perspective using Prometheus, Alertmanager is a great service to leverage as it can hook into Slack, PagerDuty, or even SMS.
Other times you may want to know when a client registers on your SaaS product, or when a client is attempting to leave. This is known as Application Performance Monitoring.
One example in my trading bot is that whenever the bot executes a trade or a stoploss is invoked, send me a slack message.</description></item></channel></rss>
