When looking at it from a passive monitoring perspective using Prometheus, Alertmanager is a great service to leverage as it can hook into Slack, PagerDuty, or even SMS.
Other times you may want to know when a client registers on your SaaS product, or when a client is attempting to leave. This is known as Application Performance Monitoring.
One example in my trading bot is that whenever the bot executes a trade or a stoploss is invoked, send me a slack message.</description></item><item><title>Passive Monitoring</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-01-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-01-monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring is a big topic. I can attempt to simplify it into a few categories.
- Passive Infrastructure Monitoring: Track CPU, Memory, Load, Uptime, Network, etc
- Log shipping: This is where your services stream their logs and you set alerts or metrics on certain patterns
- Active Monitoring: Ping your servers on a timer for aliveness/health, or a full verification of an API endpoint and its response
- Application Performance Monitoring: Metrics through code injection/addition to view application metrics</description></item><item><title>Ansible, why didn&#39;t I use this sooner</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2017-07-01-ansible/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2017-07-01-ansible/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Linux since 2008. Back then, I mostly used a spare machine to run FreeNAS, Apache, MySQL, Python to host a static or Wordpress website.
Then as I got more invested with projects running on Linux, I started to set up VPSes to start hosting online in 2011.
Everytime, it was the same process. Login as root, set up new user, disable root, set up PKA, enable firewall&amp;hellip; etcetc.</description></item></channel></rss>
