I can attempt to simplify it into a few categories.
- Passive Infrastructure Monitoring: Track CPU, Memory, Load, Uptime, Network, etc
- Log shipping: This is where your services stream their logs and you set alerts or metrics on certain patterns
- Active Monitoring: Ping your servers on a timer for aliveness/health, or a full verification of an API endpoint and its response
- Application Performance Monitoring: Metrics through code injection/addition to view application metrics</description></item></channel></rss>
