From there, they can create a PR for other developers to review the code. After the PR is approved, the code can be merged into develop or master branches. Without continous integration and deployment, the new code has to be manually verified for integration and manually deployed. This is generally a tedious, repeated task.</description></item><item><title>Notifications</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-04-notifications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-04-notifications/</guid><description>Notifications make monitoring useful.
When looking at it from a passive monitoring perspective using Prometheus, Alertmanager is a great service to leverage as it can hook into Slack, PagerDuty, or even SMS.
Other times you may want to know when a client registers on your SaaS product, or when a client is attempting to leave. This is known as Application Performance Monitoring. One example in my trading bot is that whenever the bot executes a trade or a stoploss is invoked, send me a slack message.</description></item><item><title>Passive Monitoring</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-01-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-06-01-monitoring/</guid><description>Monitoring is a big topic. I can attempt to simplify it into a few categories.
Passive Infrastructure Monitoring: Track CPU, Memory, Load, Uptime, Network, etc Log shipping: This is where your services stream their logs and you set alerts or metrics on certain patterns Active Monitoring: Ping your servers on a timer for aliveness/health, or a full verification of an API endpoint and its response Application Performance Monitoring: Metrics through code injection/addition to view application metrics The one I want to discuss today is passive monitoring.</description></item><item><title>Millions of Inserts | The ideal database?</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-03-01-insertingdata/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2018-03-01-insertingdata/</guid><description>Disclaimer: I haven&amp;rsquo;t ran any benchmarks or ran any of these databases in HA mode for proof of concepts but this was my experience with trying to work with lots of data for my HFT Trading Bot.
The Data: (all indexed on time)
1 minute candle: {timestamp, instrument, high, low, open close, volume, trades}, 1 inserts per minute Individual trade: {timestamp, instrument, price, side, type}, 0-2000 inserts per minute Individual order: {timestamp, instrument, price, side, type, status}, 0-5000 inserts per minute Note: There will exist one collection/database per exchange as certain exchanges provide more valuable information than others.</description></item><item><title>Ansible, why didn't I use this sooner</title><link>https://samsongama.com/post/2017-07-01-ansible/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/post/2017-07-01-ansible/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Linux since 2008. Back then, I mostly used a spare machine to run FreeNAS, Apache, MySQL, Python to host a static or Wordpress website. Then as I got more invested with projects running on Linux, I started to set up VPSes to start hosting online in 2011. Everytime, it was the same process. Login as root, set up new user, disable root, set up PKA, enable firewall&amp;hellip; etcetc.</description></item></channel></rss>
