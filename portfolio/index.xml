I never really believed in it as a currency back then because I thought there was no way soverign nations would allow such a currency to circumvent their own. Additionally, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it had any intrinsic value. Fast forward three years, Bitcoin hits $1000. People call it overvalued. They offer their expert layman advice and tell everyone they know not to buy Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Absolute Software</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2017-06-05-absolute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2017-06-05-absolute/</guid><description>I was brought on as a backend developer to design and create components of a massive data processing pipeline. However, my skills and understanding of DevOps allowed me to take on more responsibilities and make better decisions for the data pipeline.
One of my greatest accomplishments at Absolute has been changing the inbound data pipeline to leverage Kubernetes amazing autoscaling and Golang impressive asynchronous capabilities to increase the throughput of the pipeline by 2000% while reducing memory consumption by 90%.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning &amp; NLP Capstone</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2017-01-01-ubc-capstone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2017-01-01-ubc-capstone/</guid><description>For my final year project at UBC, I built a SaaS service which will infer context from some textual or image input in order to better target advertisment parameters.
The service will infer the time window, place, and sentiment from the input and then suggest advertisement parameters.
In order to do so, we leveraged multiple third parties such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson and more. Additionally, we built our own models and use libraries such as Google’s Tensorflow and Syntaxnet to further process the inputs.</description></item><item><title>Kudolife</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2016-09-01-kudolife/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2016-09-01-kudolife/</guid><description>Between January to August 2016, I was a full-stack developer on the Kudolife App at Prizm Media. During my time, I published multiple iOS and Android releases. Optimized the server stack for the backend in addition to creating new APIs and removing bugs that were revealed from testing. The result was an on average across the platform a 50% reduction in response time and a much more fluid user experience.</description></item><item><title>Ericsson Openstack</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2016-01-01-ericsson-openstack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2016-01-01-ericsson-openstack/</guid><description>• Debugged and assisted in the development of an OpenStack Neutron plugin for managing virtual Ericsson routers

Both the transmitter and receiver were programmed in C, however the Android Application was programmed in Java. We addressed the project requirements by creating an effective solution with an Android application which allowed users to send commands with a tablet or a phone.</description></item><item><title>Heart Rate Monitor</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2014-03-01-heart-rate-monitor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2014-03-01-heart-rate-monitor/</guid><description>For this module, I designed, built, programmed, and tested a microcontroller-based photoelectric heart rate monitor. This type of heart rate monitors are attached to a patients’ finger to measure their heart rate in beats-per-minute (BPM). The device I built is based on a non-invasive photo transmitter/receiver pair sensor which detects small variations of blood flow in the fingers due to the heart pumping action. After filtering and amplifying such variations, a microcontroller useable signal can be generated.</description></item><item><title>Oven Controller</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2014-02-01-over-controller/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2014-02-01-over-controller/</guid><description>I worked in a group of six to build a reflow soldering oven controller in assembly for the DE2-8052 microcontroller and a Java application which allowed users to set their reflow parameters using the FPGA or an Android device of their choice.

What is personalized learning?
The focus of personalized learning is to provide each individual a pathway to explore areas of learning that are based on personal passions. It means providing a more personalized learning experience centred on each person’s engagement, self-direction and self-management.</description></item><item><title>King George Website</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2010-10-01-kg-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2010-10-01-kg-website/</guid><description>This is the product of several like-minded students coming together to make a new school website. Being one of the five webmasters of this site, I have been part of this website since the conception of the idea to make a new school website back in 2010. Due to other commitments at the time, the website only went live in August 2011. Since then it has been in integral part of the school’s culture used for every major event.</description></item><item><title>Green Screen Projects</title><link>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2010-09-01-green-screen/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://samsongama.com/portfolio/2010-09-01-green-screen/</guid><description>For every video project assigned in high school, my friend Albert Hynek and I would often make videos that require the use of a green screen. He was always responsible for filming and editing while I was always responsible for the manipulation of the clips. The software I used to manipulate the green screens within the clips was Adobe After Effects CS5/6.
On a sidenote, most of our video projects always seemed to carry a Star Trek theme as identifiable by the screenshot on the right.</description></item></channel></rss>
