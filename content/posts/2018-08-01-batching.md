Some of the previous posts I've made regarding Inserting Data and Spark Or Not have been in regards to my HFT Trading Bot. Likewise, this post will also be my experiences and the things I've learned throughout this project.

I have to save a lot of incoming data from the cryptocurrency exchanges and save it immeadiately for immediate processing. Previously, I used to subscribe to websockets and insert the data one at a time as data came in into the database which gave me a high degree of certainty that any subsequent query would query the latest data possible.

Unfortunately, in times of high volume. My system could record up to 50 million USD of movement within one movement in trades.
