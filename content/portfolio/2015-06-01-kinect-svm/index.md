•	Used SVMs to detect shapes drawn on a piece of paper which corresponded to a task on a host machine

•	Determined if a user was pressing a drawn button using the depth data from the Kinect

•	Implemented multithreading in order to maintain 1080P video capture and SVM detection simultaneously at 30FPS

•	Created a utility application which allowed us to rapidly train SVMs with new shapes for different OS tasks
