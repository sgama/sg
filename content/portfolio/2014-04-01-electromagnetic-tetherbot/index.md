For project two of EECE 281, my teammates and I built a Electromagnetic Tetherbot which would follow a electromagnetic signal generated by a transmitter and various other functions mentioned in the embedded video. Both the transmitter and receiver were programmed in C, however the Android Application was programmed in Java. We addressed the project requirements by creating an effective solution with an Android application which allowed users to send commands with a tablet or a phone. This provided a better overall user experience over the regular push-button method.

This project was a tremendous success as we met and exceeded the expectations outlined in the project.
