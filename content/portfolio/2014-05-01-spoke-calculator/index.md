The Spoke Calculator is a multi-purpose tool which allows users to both visualize their wheel build and determine the length of spokes necessary for the build. This is an important calculation as the tolerances for wheel builds are very low.

The Spoke Calculator was made with HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript with extensive use of the Javascript Vector Graphics library JSGL.
