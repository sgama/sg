For every video project assigned in high school, my friend Albert Hynek and I would often make videos that require the use of a green screen. He was always responsible for filming and editing while I was always responsible for the manipulation of the clips. The software I used to manipulate the green screens within the clips was Adobe After Effects CS5/6.

On a sidenote, most of our video projects always seemed to carry a Star Trek theme as identifiable by the screenshot on the right. Iâ€™m not a Star Trek fan but I had a lot of fun working on these projects. They allowed me to become really proficient with the software which expanded my toolset for future projects.
