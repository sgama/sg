During my time as one of the administrators of Endless-Sphere, I have accomplished the following:

- migrated the forum from a rather expensive and unreliable VPS to AWS
- reduced costs and sysadmin time by automating backups and using some of AWS's managed services
- introduced SSL certificates by LetsEncrypt which cut costs even more

You can find me on the forum as user gammaray!

With nearly 25,000 users, Endless-Sphere is possibly the biggest Electric Vehicle Enthusiasts Forum in the world.
