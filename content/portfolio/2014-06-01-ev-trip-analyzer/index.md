The Trip Analyzer is a web application for analyzing analog and digital data recorded on electric bicycles for the purpose of scruntizing trip data which allows for further analysis. I developed this application during my Engineering Co-op work term at Grin Technologies (more commonly known as ebikes.ca) and was the lead software developer on this project since it has been in motion.

The Trip Analyzer parses and extrapolates data which is outputted by the Cycle Analyst during a users trip and allows the user to view their speed, power consumption, efficiency and elevation data plotted against various axis. There is even the option to upload a trip and share it via a short link created by the application. A screenshot of the trip analyzer should be on the right. A link to the trip analyzer will be placed here. (LINK TBA with UBC Trip)

The Trip Analyzer was written in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and JQuery.

The following APIs were used:
Google Maps – for plotting bike route
DyGraphs – for plotting various series
LZ-String – for compression/decompression of uploaded/downloaded data

There were many challenges in creating this application and if you would like to ask me a few questions, feel free to contact me via the contact page on my website.
