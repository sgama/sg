• Created a 2D arcade game in C running on a custom embedded system implemented on the Altera DE2 FPGA

• Designed the embedded system with a NIOS II processor on the Altera DE2 FPGA using VHDL and Verilog

• Simulated a 3D perspective using image manipulation by resizing and shifting images as the game progressed

• Achieved delay free audio playback by using hardware timers and interrupts

• Achieved a high frame rate by only redrawing pixels that changed between frames in front of a static background

• Created a Ethernet driver to facilitate communication between multiple systems to provide multiplayer support
