Between January to August 2016, I was a full-stack developer on the Kudolife App at Prizm Media. During my time, I published multiple iOS and Android releases. Optimized the server stack for the backend in addition to creating new APIs and removing bugs that were revealed from testing. The result was an on average across the platform a 50% reduction in response time and a much more fluid user experience.

Check out the iOS and Android applications on the iTunes and Google Play Store
