I worked with a group of six members including myself to build a reflow soldering oven controller in assembly for the DE2-8052 microcontroller and a Java application which allowed users to set their reflow parameters using the FPGA or an Android device of their choice. We addressed the project requirements by creating an effective solution in assembly and added the ability to transmit data over serial to a Java application which created a strip chart for the current oven temperature and additionally hosted the SQLite database necessary for the integration of our Android application. The Android application which allowed users to set their desired reflow parameters and additionally receive real-time temperature readings and elapsed time which provided a better overall user experience.

This project was a tremendous success as we met and exceeded the expectations outlined in the project.
