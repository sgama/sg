I've been following Bitcoin since 2011. I never really believed in it as a currency back then because I thought there was no way soverign nations would allow such a currency to circumvent their own, but also because it had no intrinsive value.

Fast forward three years, Bitcoin hits $1000. People call it overvalued. They offer their expert layman advice and tell everyone that they know to not buy Bitcoin.
This in my opinion is when Bitcoin first made its presence known to many software developers. This is when I believe I saw the bots in action on MtGox. To be clear, not my bots, but other peoples bots.

I didn't think about it too much back then. I was only 17 years old at the time and didn't have the aptitude for financial markets.

As the years went by, my software skills grew. I started writing microservices, deploying SaaS products, even worked on a start up.
I did several projects relating to Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Worked in Silcon Valley, studied on exchange. I really broadened my horizons over the years.

Fast forward a bit over the boring stuff...
It is now May 2017. Bitcoin just broke $2000. They are many high volume cryptocurrency exchanges around. I notice even more bots on these exchanges. That's when it dawned on me.

This scene is from The Dark Knight when Bane breaks into Gotham's version of Wall Street to rob. When the day trader assumes he wants physical cash, he says "There's no money for you to rob".
To which Bane responds: "Oh really? Then why are you people here".

This was the same idea that popped into my head when I connected the dots.
There would not be any bots if there wasn't any money to be made.

I started up a few VPS servers near several exchanges servers and started scraping all the data I could.
I initally started with Python, but found it to be too slow so I moved to NodeJS. NodeJS offered lots of performance but for lots of headache as well. So I decided I'd move to the most flexible and fastest language for this task. Golang.
I rewrote all my services in Golang and started saving all the data to a PostGreSQL database.
PostGreSQL did not like consuming lots of data and for various reasons, I moved to MongoDB.

But in order to move to MongoDB completely, I needed to migrate my old data from PostGreSQL to Mongo. That's when I found out MongoDB did not like millions of inserts. Since I wanted to avoid replication strategies for my project at this stage, I realized I had to find a better solution.

I eventually moved to a Time Series Database called InfluxDB to handle all my scraping needs.

A few months went by...
I amassed a 40GB dataset, and learned a lot about the financial markets and machine learning. 
I tried out possibly hundreds of strategies based on financial technical indicators, wrote several backtesting tools and graphing tools to visualize the strategies.

In fact, without spoiling too much, here's a peek:

This was my backtesting and visualization frontend I had created for this project. It interacted with my own API I created specifically to query and process both my raw and transformed data.

Here we are today, my bot makes 1.3% returns per week in USD after adjusting for volatility through the use of pattern matching, technical analysis, and machine learning.
I continuously monitor its performance and signals through Grafana, and I'm sure you're curious to know what that looks like so I'll give a sneak peak.
Note: I have not shown any of the graphs that actually give away my strategy and machine learning models inner workings.

TODO: Currently working on another layer of interfence using Genetic Programming to allow the program to make its own decision instead of having set execution requirements right now.
