For my final year project at UBC, I will be building a SAAS product which will infer context from some textual or image input.

The service will infer the time window, place, and sentiment from the input.

In order to do so, we will be leveraging multiple third parties such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Rekognition, IBM Watson and more. Additionally, we will be building our own models and use libraries such as Googleâ€™s Tensorflow and Syntaxnet to further process the inputs.

The project is also being deployed using Docker and TravisCI for Continuous Development.
