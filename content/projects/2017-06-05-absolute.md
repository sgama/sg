I was brought on as a backend developer to design and create components of a massive data processing pipeline. However, my skills and understanding of DevOps allowed me to take on more responsibilities and make better decisions for the data pipeline.

One of my greatest accomplishments at Absolute has been changing the inbound data pipeline to leverage Kubernetes amazing autoscaling and Golang impressive asynchronous capabilities to increase the throughput of the pipeline by 2000% while reducing memory consumption by 90%.

I have created various internal tools to loadtest and generate mock data for devices.

Automated some tasks in Jenkins to avoid unnecessary grunt work and more.
