This is the product of several like-minded students coming together to make a new school website. Being one of the five webmasters of this site, I have been part of this website since the conception of the idea to make a new school website back in 2010. Due to other commitments at the time, the website only went live in August 2011. Since then it has been in integral part of the schoolâ€™s culture used for every major event. From advertising school events, to showing each students assignments due dates, to being a hub for the community. We also provided live-streaming for our home basketball games since our senior teams were very successful during the 2011-2012 season. This service was made available to the public and had provided a lot of positive attention for the schools IT department.

Since then, the VSB has undergone a regime change and the new IT director wants to centralize all the school websites which means that the current student-made website might disappear in the near future.

Partners on this project: Albert Hynek, Chris Lee, Thomas Fischer
